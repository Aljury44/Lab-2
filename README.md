Automation Risk Classification (Job Automation Risk)

Automation Risk Classification

Problem Type:

- Supervised Learning – Classification

Problem Description

- In this project, the goal is to predict the automation risk level of different jobs. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, some jobs are more likely to be automated than others. This project aims to analyze job-related features and classify each job into one of three categories: Low risk, Medium risk, or High risk.

- The dataset includes features such as Industry, AI maturity stage, Core skills, Year, and Country. Based on these features, the model will learn patterns and relationships that help determine the level of automation risk.


Target Variable:

- Automation Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Input Features:
	•	Industry
	•	AI maturity stage
	•	Core skills
	•	Year
	•	Country

Objective:

- The objective of this model is to classify jobs into the correct automation risk category based on their characteristics. This will help in understanding how AI adoption and industry factors influence job automation.
